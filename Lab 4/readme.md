# Prompt Quizzer – JavaScript Quiz Game

## 📌 Overview
Prompt Quizzer is a simple JavaScript-based quiz game that runs entirely in the **browser console**.  
The game displays a series of questions using `prompt()`, checks the user's answers, provides instant feedback using `alert()`, and finally displays the total score.

This project demonstrates the use of JavaScript fundamentals such as arrays, loops, string methods, conditionals, and functions.
